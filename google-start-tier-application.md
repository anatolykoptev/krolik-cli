### Product description (short)
```
Multi-Tier AI Orchestration CLI tool for TypeScript developers. Automatically routes AI tasks to optimal model tiers, reducing costs by 90% through intelligent model selection.
```

### Product description (detailed - if asked)
```
Krolik Felix is an open-source CLI tool that helps developers optimize AI API costs through intelligent multi-tier model routing.

The system analyzes task complexity and automatically selects the most cost-effective AI model from four tiers (Free, Cheap, Mid, Premium). Simple tasks like code formatting use free models, while complex tasks like architecture design use premium models.

Key features:
- Automatic model selection based on task complexity
- Cascade fallback for reliability
- SQLite-based learning from historical success patterns
- Native TypeScript integration
- 90% cost reduction compared to always using premium models

Target users: TypeScript developers, AI application builders, startups optimizing AI costs.
```

### Use case for Google Cloud
```
We will use Google Cloud credits for:

1. Vertex AI API integration:
   - Gemini 2.0 Flash for mid-tier routing
   - Gemini 1.5 Pro for complex tasks
   - Testing model performance across tiers

2. Cloud Run:
   - Deploying serverless API endpoints
   - Scaling based on usage patterns

3. Cloud Storage:
   - Caching model responses
   - Storing routing history for learning

4. Cloud Build:
   - CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
   - Multi-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)

5. Cloud Functions:
   - Webhook handlers for GitHub integrations
   - Event-driven task processing

This will help us validate product-market fit and build integrations with Google's AI ecosystem.

## 5. Additional Information

### How did you hear about Google for Startups?
```
Google Search / Online Research
```

### Why do you need Google Cloud credits?
```
As a bootstrapped open-source project, Google Cloud credits will enable us to:

1. Build and test Google AI integrations (Vertex AI/Gemini)
2. Validate product-market fit without upfront infrastructure costs
3. Scale serverless architecture as user base grows
4. Provide free tier to early adopters while maintaining quality

The $2,000 credit will cover 6-12 months of development and testing, allowing us to prove value before monetization.
```

### Tell us about your startup (optional but recommended)
```
Krolik Felix is an open-source developer tool addressing the growing challenge of AI cost optimization. As AI becomes ubiquitous, developers face the dilemma: use expensive premium models for everything (high cost) or use cheap models (poor quality).

Our solution: intelligent multi-tier routing that automatically selects the right model for each task. Developers get 90% cost savings without sacrificing quality where it matters.

Built for the TypeScript ecosystem, we integrate with modern frameworks (Next.js, tRPC, Prisma) and provide a CLI-first experience. Currently bootstrapped by a solo developer, seeking validation through the TypeScript developer community.

Open-source strategy: FSL-1.1 license (converts to Apache 2.0 after 2 years) enables community adoption while maintaining sustainable business model.

Next milestones:
- 100 GitHub stars
- 1,000 npm downloads/month
- 10 active community contributors
- Partnership with AI model providers

Google Cloud's Vertex AI and serverless infrastructure align perfectly with our technical needs and target market.
```

### What is your company's mission?
```
Make AI development cost-effective and accessible for every developer, regardless of budget.
```
